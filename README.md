IdealTF
===============

### **Notice: IdealTF's development has stopped and no new releases will be made again. ALL bots will no longer work and will 'self-destruct' on launch. This has been planned for a while due to the discovery of the bot's structure violating Steam's SSA. Thanks.**

IdealTF *was* a free steam trading bot for Windows programmed in C#, Batch and AutoHotKey allowing the automation of Steam Trading (Including Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO). It can accept trades in as little as 20 seconds! It offers plenty of customisation and features including open-source code!
